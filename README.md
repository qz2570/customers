This is a skeleton you can use to start your projects

## Overview

This project template contains starter code for your class project. The `/service` folder contains your `models.py` file for your model and a `routes.py` file for your service. The `/tests` folder has test case starter code for testing the model and the service separately. All you need to do is add your functionality. You can use the [lab-flask-tdd](https://github.com/nyu-devops/lab-flask-tdd) for code examples to copy from.

## Automatic Setup

The best way to use this repo is to start your own repo using it as a git template. To do this just press the green **Use this template** button in GitHub and this will become the source for your repository.

## Manual Setup

You can also clone this repository and then copy and paste the starter code into your project repo folder on your local computer. Be careful not to copy over your own `README.md` file so be selective in what you copy.

There are 4 hidden files that you will need to copy manually if you use the Mac Finder or Windows Explorer to copy files from this folder into your repo folder.

These should be copied using a bash shell as follows:

```bash
    cp .gitignore  ../<your_repo_folder>/
    cp .flaskenv ../<your_repo_folder>/
    cp .gitattributes ../<your_repo_folder>/
```

## Contents

The project contains the following:

# Customer team

## Code Standard
- use snake_case, like `this_is_snake_case_variable`.
- always keep code formatted, VSCode extension `Prettier` is recommended.
- Run make lint and aim for the highest possible score. By the end of the sprint, the code should achieve a rating of **10.00/10**, and the test coverage should reach **at least 95%**.

## Workflow
- Before working on a story, check if there are any stories in 'Review/QA'. If so, find the corresponding pull request and test it yourself. If everything works well, move the story to the 'Done' section, **and delete the branch**.
- When you work on a story, always select the top story from the 'sprint backlog' without dependency on in progress stories, drag it into 'In Progress', and assign it to yourself. Pull the latest code from GitHub, create a new branch, and write your code on that branch.
- When you finish working on a story, commit your branch to GitHub, create a new pull request, and link it to the corresponding story. Then, drag it into 'Review/QA'.
- Add unit tests for your stories, **covering both happy and sad paths**.
- test
